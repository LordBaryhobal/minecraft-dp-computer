# Minecraft Datapack Computer

This repository contains my Minecraft computer datapack ([cb_computer](cb_computer)).

Minecraft version 1.17+, no mods required.

You may find a tutorial on how to use it in [tutorial.md](tutorial.md). Some example programs are included in the datapack (see [examples.md](examples.md)).

To create your own script, check out [scripting.md](scripting.md).
